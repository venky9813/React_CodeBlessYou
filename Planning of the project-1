Planning of the project
First we can build our UI part

After that we will add functionality for them



Props
Props is a way to pass data from parent component to the child component. In props we can pass any type of data like string, number, boolean, array, object or even functions.

So for passing the props, in component we add attribute with any name then we can pass our value in it.

Now for getting the props value, we can pass props as parameter in the child component function. Remember this props is object. So we have to write props.tagName
